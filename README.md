An Open-Source Computer Repair Ticket System

### What is Bitket?
Bitket is aimed at streamlining the operations of local computer repair shops by creating an effective event-based ticket system that also handles CRM to keep track of everyone that steps into the front door.

### Installation
Bitket is so alpha it isn't even funny.  When I have built more structure into Bitket, I will let you know how to install it.
